# CDDA-Tileset-Editor

A tileset editor for Cataclysm DDA.

Warning: The source is a complete mess. Completely hacked together.


## Licensing

The code and the icon have different licenses, see ICONLICENSE.

In short, you can do just about anything you want with the code, but the icon is mine.


## How to Build

### Linux
1. Run `sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk`
2. Run `sudo apt install ant`
3. Navigate to base directory of CDDATSE.
4. Run `ant`

The built editor should be in the `dispatch` folder.
